<h3>The Shadow</h3>
<p>An underrated gem featuring 1930s aesthetics at their most glamorous.</p>

<h3>The Banquet</h3>
<p>A retelling a Shakespeare's "Hamlet" in long-ago China. Sumptious Visuals, heart-rending performances.</p>

<h3>Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</h3>
<p>Arguably the most beautiful animated film ever made.</p>
